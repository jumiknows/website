              <p>
                Founded in 2017, Momentus was born out of countless discussions with satellite operators looking for rides to destinations which weren't commercially 
                being offered. Their mission is simple: they want enterprise and existence to flourish in space and they know that creating truly efficient in-space 
                transportation will make that possible.

                and big engineering teams to build things which seem like magic to us today.
